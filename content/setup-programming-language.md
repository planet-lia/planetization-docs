This is a quick list of all the requirements needed for all supported languages in which you can develop your bot.


## Java
* Install [Java JDK](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html). 
We officially support Java 8 but if you have a never version it should work as well.
* [Setup JAVA_HOME](https://www.baeldung.com/java-home-on-windows-7-8-10-mac-os-x-linux) environment variable to point to the directory where you have installed Java JDK.

## Python3 
* Install Python3 as instructed on the official site https://www.python.org/. 
* Make sure to add Python3 to path. On Windows there is a checkbox available when installing Python3.
* On our servers your bun runs using Python3.6 so make sure your version is compatible with it.

## Kotlin
* The requirements are the same as for `Java`.
