Welcome to Lia, a free competitive coding game for programmers. 
Here you can test your coding skills, have fun battling other programers and participate in a friendly community.
The core Lia team consists out of three computer science students who are creating Lia in their spare time. 
We value your feedback, so please if you have any new ideas, have encountered a bug or if you would like to ask us a question, feel free to create a post on our <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/liagame/" target="_blank">Reddit forum</a> or contact us on any of our social media (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/liagame/" target="_blank">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://www.github.com/liagame/" target="_blank">Github</a>, <a href="mailto:info@liagame.com" target="_blank">Email</a>, <a href="https://discord.gg/weXRxyU" target="_blank">Discord chat</a>).

We are planning open source Lia as soon as we get some extra time.
