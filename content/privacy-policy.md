## What Data We Collect and Why

When you use your Lia CLI tool to create your bot, fight your bots with each other or use any other Lia-CLI commands we anonymously record (if you opt-in) which CLI commands you have run and which parameters you have used. 
This data is then anonymously sent to Google Analytics.

This way we are able to see which commands are used by our community and by doing that we can then see how the Lia-SDK is used. 
This way we can better detect where the bottlenecks are in your Lia experience and thus we can better decide what we need to fix or add next. 

All in all, the data we collect will not expose your identity but it will immensely contribute in making the Lia experience as enjoyable as possible.
