title: Game Description
---

In Lia you command an army of biological robots or biobots using your programming skills. Your mission is to hijack a computer by eliminating an opponent programmer's army. 

You start the game with a predefined number of biobots which you can move around the map, make them shoot and teach them very simple or super advanced tactic to detect, track down and eliminate the opponent. To do that you can use your favourite programming language and your favourite development tools,  and then test out your code on your local machine by fighting your bot against itself, older versions of itself, or example bots that are provided by Lia team. Whenever you are ready you can then upload your bot online to battle countless other programmers around the world!
